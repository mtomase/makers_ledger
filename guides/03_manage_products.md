*Purpose: This is the central hub for defining each of your sellable products and all their associated cost components. The data entered here directly drives the calculations in the "Product Cost Breakdown" analysis.*

*Concept: Each product you sell has its own unique "recipe" of materials, requires specific labor activities for its creation and shipping, uses particular packaging, and should bear a fair share of your business's overheads. Furthermore, each product might have different selling prices and incur different fees depending on the channel through which it's sold (e.g., retail website vs. a wholesale marketplace). This section allows you to meticulously detail all these aspects for each product.*
