**Understanding Key Metrics & Sections:**

#### **A. Summary Metrics (Displayed at the Top):**
These three headline figures give you an immediate overview of the selected product's financial health.

- **`Total Production Cost/Item`**:
    - **Concept:** This is the **fully loaded cost** to produce one single unit of the selected product. It represents every expense incurred to get one item ready for sale, *before* considering any costs associated with the specific selling channel.
    - **Components:** It's the sum of Direct Material Costs, Direct Labor Costs (production & shipping), Direct Packaging Costs, and Allocated Overheads.
    - **Significance:** This is your baseline cost. You must sell above this price to even begin making a profit on the item itself.

- **`Target Price (with Buffer)`**:
    - **Concept:** This is a suggested selling price that covers your `Total Production Cost/Item` plus a safety margin ("buffer").
    - **Calculation:** `Total Production Cost/Item * (1 + Buffer Percentage)`.
    - **Significance:** Use this as a guide when setting your actual prices. Selling below this consistently means you're eating into your safety margin or desired profit.

- **`Blended Avg Profit/Item`**:
    - **Concept:** An average profit calculated across your different selling channels (Retail and Wholesale), weighted by your defined sales distribution mix.
    - **Significance:** A powerful indicator of the overall average profitability of this product, considering your entire sales strategy.

#### **B. Detailed Breakdown Expanders:**

- **üí∞ Direct COGS (Cost of Goods Sold) Details:**
    - **Concept:** COGS represents costs that are *directly* attributable to producing the goods you sell.
    - **Breakdown:** Includes tables detailing `Total Material Cost/Item`, `Total Production Labor Cost/Item`, `Total Shipping Labor Cost/Item (Direct)`, and `Total Packaging Cost/Item`. The final `Subtotal Direct COGS/Item` is a key metric representing your variable costs.

- **üè¢ Allocated Overheads per Item:**
    - **Concept:** Shows the portion of your fixed business expenses (rent, utilities, global salaries) that has been allocated to one unit of this product, based on your inputs in the "Manage Products" section.

#### **C. Channel Performance Analysis (per Item - Retail vs. Wholesale):**
This section provides a side-by-side comparison of profitability through your retail and wholesale channels.
- For each channel, you'll see:
    - `Price`: Your selling price for that channel.
    - *Channel-Specific Fees:* Calculated fees (e.g., CC Fee, Platform Fee, Commission) based on your inputs.
    - `Total Channel Costs`: The sum of all fees and applicable shipping costs for that channel.
    - `Total Cost (Production + Channel Fees)`: The *total cost to get one item to the customer* via that channel.
    - `Profit per Item`: The actual monetary profit for one item sold through this channel.
    - `Margin (%)`: The profit as a percentage of the selling price for that channel.

---
#### **D. Blended Performance (Weighted by Distribution):**
These metrics provide an overall picture of your product's financial health, considering your sales mix.
- **Metrics:** `Weighted Average Selling Price/Item`, `Weighted Average Total Cost/Item`, `Weighted Average Profit/Item`, and `Weighted Average Margin (%)`.
- **Significance:** These blended figures are crucial for understanding the product's overall financial viability given your current sales strategy.

*By regularly reviewing this entire breakdown, you can identify areas to improve efficiency, negotiate better supplier prices, adjust your own selling prices, and make strategic decisions about which products to focus on and how to sell them.*
