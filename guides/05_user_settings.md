### Updating Your Profile & Password
*Purpose: To manage your personal account details and security settings within the application.*

*Concept: Keeping your profile information up-to-date can help personalize your experience (e.g., with a display name). Maintaining a strong, unique password enhances the security of your valuable business data stored within the application.*

**Profile Information:**
- **`Username`:** This is your unique login identifier and cannot be changed after registration.
- **`Name`:** This is the display name used in the welcome message in the sidebar (e.g., "Welcome, John Doe!"). You can change this to your preferred name or business name.
- **`Email`:** Your email address associated with the account. While not currently used for notifications or password resets by this application, it's good practice to keep it current for potential future features.
- **How to Update:** Enter your desired `Name` and/or `Email` into the respective fields and click the **"Save User Details"** button. The changes will be saved, and your display name in the sidebar will update upon the next page refresh or interaction.

**Update Password:**
- **Concept:** Regularly updating your password is a good security practice to protect your account from unauthorized access. Choose a password that is strong (a mix of upper/lower case letters, numbers, and symbols) and unique to this application.
- **How to Update:**
    1.  Enter your *current* password in the "Current Password" field. This is required to verify your identity before a password change is allowed.
    2.  Enter your *new* password in the "New Password" field.
    3.  Repeat your *new* password in the "Repeat New Password" field to ensure you've typed it correctly.
    4.  Click the **"Reset password"** button.
- If successful, your password will be updated in the system. You will need to use this new password for your next login.
