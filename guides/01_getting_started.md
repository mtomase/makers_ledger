### Navigating the App
*Purpose: To understand how to move between different sections of the application.*

*Concept: The application is organized into distinct modules, each handling a specific aspect of cost management. The sidebar menu is your primary tool for navigation.*

- Click on any menu item (e.g., "Manage Ingredients," "Manage Products," "Product Cost Breakdown") to navigate to that specific section. The content in the main panel of the application will update to reflect your selection.
- Your currently selected menu item is typically highlighted in the sidebar for easy reference.
- To log out of the application and secure your data, click the "Logout" button, which is also located in the sidebar.
